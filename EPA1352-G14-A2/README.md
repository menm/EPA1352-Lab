## Introduction
For Assignment 2 of the EPA1352 Advanced Simulation course, a transport model demo has been created to analyze the 
economic vital N1 road from Chittagong to Dhaka in Bangladesh. This transport model runs
based on a multiple files:
* model.py, see EPA1352-G14-A2/model/model.py, which takes N1_infrastructure.csv as an input file that specifies the infrastructure model components to be generated. 
* model_run.py, see EPA1352-G14-A2/model/model_run.py, which runs the model and the experiments.
* components.py, see EPA1352-G14-A2/model/components.py, which defines the various infrastructure components. 
* model_viz, see EPA1352-G14-A2/model/model_viz.py, which runs the model with visualization.

## How to Use

Include whatever you think is necessary for someone to understand your work. The README file is usually the first file someone will see and open. It doesn't need to explain what might be obvious, but it should point out the most important things for someone looking at your work. For example, how to launch your program, what are the main files, where to find them, etc. 
In order to run the model, it is necessary to place the file N1_infrastructre.csv into the data folder. Then select 

### Format

Most README files for data or software projects are now written in Markdown format, like this document. There are some different flavours, but they are easy to write. See here for more information https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax 

Most IDEs can render Markdown files directly.
